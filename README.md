## FAQ

### 1. How can I make a Spigot server?

Since Paper is a fork of Spigot, you can use it with all Spigot/Bukkit plugins as well. For more details, go to their [Github page](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) or their [Official page](https://papermc.io/).

### 2. How can I make a Bungeecord server?

Since Waterfall is a fork of Bungeecord, you can use it with all Bungeecord plugins as well. It is made by the same creator of Paper. For more details, go to their [Github page](https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall) or their [Official page](https://papermc.io/).

### 3. How can I make a Vanilla server?

It is not possible to make a pure Vanilla server on a Minecraft server network. The closest thing to it is a Paper server without any plugins.

### 4. I'm getting an unexpected error. How can I solve this?

Check if your configuration files have the correct values. In most cases, that should be your solution. It uses the [Liquid template engine](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). If you still can't solve your problem, please create a [Github issue](https://github.com/Samuel-Martineau/MC-Config-Controller/issues).
